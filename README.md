# Tribonacci Sequence Calculator

This Python program computes the n-th value of the Tribonacci sequence, a variation of the Fibonacci sequence where each term is the sum of the previous three terms.

## Features
- Computes the n-th Tribonacci number efficiently.
- Handles user input with validation.
- Runs continuously until the user enters a non-positive integer.

## How It Works
1. The `tribo(n)` function calculates the n-th Tribonacci number using an iterative approach.
2. The `main()` function prompts the user for an integer input and prints the corresponding Tribonacci number.
3. The program exits when the user enters a non-positive integer.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository or download the script.

## Usage
Run the script:

```bash
python script.py
```

Enter an integer to get the corresponding Tribonacci number. Enter a non-positive integer to exit.

## Example Interaction
```
Please enter the n-th value of the Tribonacci sequence: 5
The 5-th element of the Tribonacci sequence is 4.

Please enter the n-th value of the Tribonacci sequence: 7
The 7-th element of the Tribonacci sequence is 13.

Please enter the n-th value of the Tribonacci sequence: -1
Program over.
```
